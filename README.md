# Team Projects

## Ink Samurai

Ink Samurai is an on-going project that started in Helsinki as a result of the Erasmus+ opportunity.
Students were flown over to Helsinki to form a team of artists and developers to create a game prototype in 2 weeks.
My role in the team was the Project Manager, the team is comprised of 7 members, their names are credited in the last image.

Below are images of the protoype mobile game Ink Samurai.
